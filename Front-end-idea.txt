Of course! This is a great project for a hackathon. Based on your feature document, here is a front-end design concept focusing on a clean, intuitive, and AI-driven user experience.

### Core Design Philosophy

The design should be **"AI-First, User in Control."** The main interface should encourage interaction with the AI Coach, but manual controls should always be easily accessible. We'll use a clean, modern aesthetic with clear data visualizations.

The application will be a **Single Page Application (SPA)** to feel fast and responsive, with a persistent navigation structure.

### Page & Navigation Structure

You can build this entire application around **4 main pages (or "views")**.

**How to control the pages:** A static sidebar on the left of the screen will be the main navigation hub. This is a standard, user-friendly pattern for web apps.

The navigation sidebar will contain links to:
1.  **Dashboard** (Home)
2.  **Coach** (AI Chat)
3.  **Budgets** (The 6 Jars)
4.  **Transactions** (History Log)

### Page 1: The Dashboard (The "Home" Screen)

This is the first thing the user sees. It should provide an immediate, at-a-glance summary of their financial health.

**Purpose:** Give a high-level overview and showcase proactive AI insights.

**Key Components:**

*   **1. Greeting & Proactive Alert:** At the top, a personalized greeting ("Good morning, Alex!") followed by a single, actionable insight from the AI.
    *   *Maps to Feature: #4 Proactive Tracking & Alerting*
    *   **Example:** "Heads up! You've spent 70% of your 'Fun' budget, but we're only halfway through the month. Maybe pack a lunch tomorrow?"

*   **2. The 6 Jars Visualization:** The main focus of the page. A visually appealing grid or row of 6 "cards," one for each jar.
    *   *Maps to Feature: #1 Smart Income Allocation*
    *   **Each Jar Card would show:**
        *   Jar Name (e.g., "Necessities," "Long-Term Savings")
        *   A relevant icon (e.g., a house for rent, a piggy bank for savings).
        *   **Amount Remaining:** `$XXX / $YYY`
        *   **A progress bar:** Visually shows how much of that jar's budget has been spent. The bar turns yellow/red as it gets full.

*   **3. Quick Action Buttons:** Two prominent buttons to encourage primary user actions.
    *   **"Log an Expense"**: Opens a simple modal for manual entry.
    *   **"Ask the Coach"**: Jumps the user directly to the Coach/Chat page.

*   **4. Recent Transactions:** A small, scrollable list of the last 5-7 transactions, showing the description, amount, and which jar it came from.

### Page 2: The AI Coach (The "Chat" Screen)

This is the heart of your application's "smart" functionality. It should feel like a conversation.

**Purpose:** Handle all AI-assisted tasks in one place through a natural language interface.

**Key Components:**

*   **1. Chat History:** A standard chat interface with bubbles for the user's prompts and the AI's responses.
*   **2. Smart Input Box:** This is more than just a text field.
    *   *Maps to Features: #1, #2, #3 (AI-Assisted) and #5*
    *   **User types:** "I spent $10 on coffee and $50 on gas" -> AI responds: "Got it. I've logged $10 to 'Fun' and $50 to 'Transport'. Is that correct?" with "Yes/No" buttons.
    *   **User types:** "don't forget my $15 spotify subscription every month" -> AI responds: "Okay, I can set up a recurring $15 fee for 'Spotify'. Which jar should this come from?"
    *   **User types:** "can I afford a new phone?" -> AI responds with a personalized analysis based on savings and spending habits.
*   **3. "Upload Receipt" Button:** A small button next to the text input field to trigger the file upload for receipt scanning.
    *   *Maps to Feature: #2 Transaction Management (AI-Assisted)*

### Page 3: Budgets (The Jars Management Screen)

This is the user's manual control center for their budget structure.

**Purpose:** Allow users to manually create, view, and adjust their 6 jars.

**Key Components:**

*   **1. Total Income:** A field at the top where the user sets their total monthly income.
*   **2. Jars Configuration:** A list of the 6 jars.
    *   *Maps to Feature: #1 Smart Income Allocation (Manual)*
    *   Each jar in the list shows its **Name**, the **Percentage** allocated, and the calculated **Dollar Amount**.
    *   An "Edit" button next to each allows the user to change the name and percentage.
    *   A running total "Total Allocation: 95% / 100%" is displayed, which turns red if it's not exactly 100%.

*   **3. Recurring Fees Table:** A simple table below the jars.
    *   *Maps to Feature: #3 Recurring Fee Management (Manual)*
    *   **Columns:** Name, Amount, Frequency, Linked Jar.
    *   **Actions:** Edit, Delete.
    *   A "+ Add Recurring Fee" button to open a form for manual entry.

### Page 4: Transactions (The History Log)

A detailed, searchable log of all income and expenses.

**Purpose:** Allow users to review their spending history and make manual corrections.

**Key Components:**

*   **1. Date Range & Filters:** Powerful filters at the top.
    *   Filter by Jar (e.g., "Show me all 'Fun' expenses").
    *   Filter by Date Range.
    *   Search bar for descriptions (e.g., "coffee").

*   **2. Transaction List:** A clean, scrollable list or table.
    *   *Maps to Feature: #2 Transaction Management (Manual)*
    *   **Columns:** Date, Description, Amount, Jar.
    *   Each transaction is clickable to allow for editing or deleting.

*   **3. "Add Transaction" Button:** A floating action button or a button at the top to open a form for manual entry (Description, Amount, Jar, Date).

### Hackathon MVP Focus

For a hackathon, you can't build everything perfectly. Here's how to prioritize:

1.  **Must-Have:** **Dashboard** (static, for now) and the **AI Coach** page. The conversational interface is your "wow" factor. Get the front-end for the chat looking perfect.
2.  **Must-Have:** A simple pop-up/modal for **Manual Transaction Logging**. This is a core function.
3.  **Good to Have:** The full **Budgets** page with the percentage sliders. It demonstrates the core "6 Jars" concept clearly.
4.  **Can be Simplified:** The **Transactions** page can start as just a simple, unfiltered list. The advanced filtering can be a "future feature." The Proactive Alert on the dashboard can be a hard-coded example for the demo.

This structure gives you a clear path to building a functional and impressive web app that directly reflects all the features you've planned. Good luck at the hackathon
